Caffeine 9 to 5 is a commentary on the often cyclical and confusing nature of
work. Starting from the bottom going clockwise, we begin the day with sentiments
of openness, play, and ease. The mind appears to be in fluid imagination, but as
the day draws to a close, the scene is violently interrupted by a mishmash of
darkness, noise, and strange creatures. Following the disturbance, the subject
awakens to a contorted, rectangular version of himself. He then consumes his
morning beverage and embarks again on his daily adventure.

My hope with this drawing is to illustrate the cyclical dynamics of work and
to encourage the viewer to imagine new dimensions outside of the confines of
one's assumed reality.
